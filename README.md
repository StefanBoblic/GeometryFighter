This is a Fruit Ninja like game done in SceneKit. I learned how to work with:
* **The particle systmem:** How to add particle effects to my game
* **Particle system editor:** How to navigate the built-in particle system editor and how to preview your effects
* **Particle system attributes:** How to work with the numerous attributes that define the workings of a particle system
* **3D touch handling:** How to manage touch events in 3D and how to use *hitTest(_: options:)* to determine which nodes were touched inside your scene
* **Game state management:** With basic game state management you'll be able to control certain game mechanics based on a game state like TapToPlay, Playing or GameOver
